            My parents' restaurant chain was in need of a touch-free menu for their customers. Iâ€™ve been wanting to experiment with responsive web design, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I used 5 breakpoints to make this minimalistic restaurant menu to handle different various display sizes in an efficient way. This website is built with React because I found that Rreact library is the most popular one and its component management is easy to keep the front-end structure simple.
